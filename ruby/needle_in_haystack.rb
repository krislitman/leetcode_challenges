# What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

# For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

# @param {String} haystack
# @param {String} needle
# @return {Integer}
def str_str(haystack, needle)

end

# Example 1:

# Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
# Output: -1
# Example 3:

# Input: haystack = "", needle = ""
# Output: 0
