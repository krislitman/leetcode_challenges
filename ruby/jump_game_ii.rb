# Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

# You can assume that you can always reach the last index.



# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2

def jump(nums)
  l = nums.length
  e = nums.length - 1
  c = 0
  i = o
  until c == e
    num = nums[i]
    
  end
end

attempt1 = jump([2,3,1,1,4])
print(attempt1)
# expect: 2

# attempt2 = jump([2,3,0,1,3])
# print(attempt2)
# expect: 2
