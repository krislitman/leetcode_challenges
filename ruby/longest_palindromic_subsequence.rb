# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.



# Example 1:

# Input: s = "bbbab"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

# Psuedocode: Going to split the string into individual elements in an array. Then I will iterate over the array,
# and create hash objects for each distinct element. If there is more than one element, increment by one to that keys
# value. Then I will return the max value from the hash object

def longest_palindrome_subseq(s)
  split_up = s.split('')
  count_em = split_up.reduce({}) do |acc, e|
    if acc[e]
      acc[e] += 1
    else
      acc[e] = 1
    end
    acc
  end
  count_em.values.max
end

attempt1 = longest_palindrome_subseq('bbbab')
print(attempt1)
# expect: 4

attempt2 = longest_palindrome_subseq('cbbd')
print(attempt2)
# expect: 2

attempt3 = longest_palindrome_subseq('aabaa')
print(attempt3)
# expect: 5
