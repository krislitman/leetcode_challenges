# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.



# Example 1:

# Input: s = "bbbab"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

def longest_palindrome_subseq(s)

end

attempt1 = longest_palindrome_subseq('bbbab')
print(attempt1)
# expect: 4

# attempt2 = longest_palindrome_subseq('cbbd')
# print(attempt2)
# expect: 2
