# Given an integer array nums, return all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.
#
# The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered a special case of increasing sequence.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [4,6,7,7]
# Output: [[4,6],[4,6,7],[4,6,7,7],[4,7],[4,7,7],[6,7],[6,7,7],[7,7]]
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,4,3,2,1]
# Output: [[4,4]]


def find_subsequences(nums)

end

nums1 = [4,6,7,7]
attempt1 = find_subsequences(nums1) # expected => [[4,6],[4,6,7],[4,6,7,7],[4,7],[4,7,7],[6,7],[6,7,7],[7,7]]

# nums2 = [4,4,3,2,1]
# attempt2 = find_subsequences(nums2) # expected => [[4,4]]
