# Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

# Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

def move_zeroes(nums)

end



# Example 1:

one =  [0,1,0,3,12]
puts move_zeroes(one)

# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

# Example 2:

# two =  [0]
# puts move_zeroes(two)

# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: [0]
