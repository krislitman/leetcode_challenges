# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".


# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
# Output: "fl"
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
# Output:
# Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
