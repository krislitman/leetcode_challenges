# Give a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

# Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "00110011"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
# Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
# Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "10101"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
