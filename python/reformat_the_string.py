# Given alphanumeric string s. (Alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits).

# You have to find a permutation of the string where no letter is followed by another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. That is, no two adjacent characters have the same type.

#`Return the reformatted string or return an empty string if it is impossible to reformat the string.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "a0b1c2"
# Output: "0a1b2c"
# Explanation: No two adjacent characters have the same type in "0a1b2c". "a0b1c2", "0a1b2c", "0c2a1b" are also valid permutations.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "leetcode"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: "leetcode" has only characters so we cannot separate them by digits.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "1229857369"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: "1229857369" has only digits so we cannot separate them by characters.
# Example 4:

# Input: s = "covid2019"
# Output: "c2o0v1i9d"
# Example 5:

# Input: s = "ab123"
# Output: "1a2b3"
